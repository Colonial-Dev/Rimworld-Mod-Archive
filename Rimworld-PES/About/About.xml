  PES is an Artificial Willpower Substitute (TM) designed to totally nullify your capability to save scum, dev mode, or otherwise alter the inevitable arrow of events. Enjoy Rimworld the way it was meant to be played - maximum consequence, maximum drama, maximum story!
  
- PES makes the game double autosave on receipt of any letter - e.g. raid, ambrosia sprout, or colonist death. This overwrites both the main and "backup" saves with the current gamestate, making it impossible to rollback!

- PES permanently locks away dev mode and storyteller options after game start, and makes any PES-enabled saves impossible to load without PES installed and active.

!!WARNING!! - PES overrides Rimworld's internal methods for saving and loading gamestates. I am NOT responsible for any unforseen interactions between PES and other mods that lead to the loss of your save file - use at your own risk!
